# CS50x final project extension
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>

#### Description:
A chrome extension which when used converts all the images present in the **google chrome tab** to famous bollywood actor **ShahRukh Khan**.This project was inspired by my fan love for SRK and his films. As CS50 helped me in learning different skills, I made this extension as a tribute to SRK and CS50x.

## About ME:
Hello everyone, I am Abhinav Gupta and I am from Durgapur, West Bengal, India. Previously I have undergone through the whole process from week 0 to week 9 and I am here today completing my final project.

## Technologies used in my project:

I have built this project using html, css, json and javascript and I have added screenshots in the video and in this project file.

## Files used:

#### 1. manifest.json:

Over here in this file I have used **manifest version 3** which is supported by google chrome nowerdays. Older manifest versions include 1 and 2. In the name section I have named my file as **CS50 final project extension**. Currently I have made this version **0.0.1** as this is the newest version of this extension ever made by me.
The **content_scripts** contains all the _urls_ on which the project will work upon and for the javascript to execute I have created a file called **content.js**.
For the background service worker I have created a blank file called *background.js*. 
The **icons** are added using an attribute of json file called *icons* and 3 pngs of the same image( 16x16, 48x48, 128x128) have been added in *images* folder of the project file. The **action** on which when the file is executed will give out a notification using a default popup called **popup.html** and I have titled it as *cs50 fan*.
In order to get access from chrome, I have added a permissions attribute of **tabs** which gives access to all tabs. 

#### 2. content.js:

In this javascript we have loaded different ShahRukh Khan images using a tile called *cs50_images* and used a const as **siteImages** with *document.getElementsByTagName* as *img*. 
 We then added a chrome runtime listener by passing request, sender and Response. So if we request task as *srk*, our page gets loaded with different ShahRukh Khan images which we have loaded in **cs50_images**. After we have been abled to load different images on the *img* tags available on the web page, we pass the status as *done* and return the response on the console window using **sendResponse**.

#### 3. popup.html:

We have created a very simple html file with title **CS50_fan** and we linked *popup.js* javascript file and css file of *styles.css*. We then created a header where I have written what the file does on clicking a button. After that I have created a Click button over there which when clicked changes all the images on that page to SRK pictures.

#### 4. popup.js:

Here I have created a *btn.addEventListener* which gets executed which when clicked, lets a **queryOptions** active and then returns the tab id and executes a task called *srk* and which in response displays the status of *response* function.

#### 5. styles.css:

Here in the styles.css file, we have simply added margin and padding to the html file as 0,0 to the body section of **popup.html**. Next we have modified the header h1 by changing background-color, font-size, display and justify content. Similarly we have modified the button of *Click Me!!* using attributes as display, justify-content, align-items, width and height. 

#### 6. background.js:

I have created this javascript file and kept it blank as it was just for reference.

## Conclusion:

It was a very interesting project as I have created this project after learning deep concepts of javascript and it took me a lot of time studying and testing before implementing the code. I don't know that why my extension is not being displayed on the screen recording and hence I have attached screenshots in this **project** file.
